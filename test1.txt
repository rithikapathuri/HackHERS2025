ATLANTA (AP) — Donald Trump’s second administration has put forth an avalanche of policy changes and political pronouncements that have jolted Washington and the world.

That agenda is taken largely from his “Agenda 47” campaign proposals, the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 and other hard-right influencers with juice in Trump’s White House. There is much more, however, that the president and those groups discussed on the campaign trail but have yet to attempt.

Here’s a look at some substantial proposals still pending.

Shuttering the Department of Education
The right has long targeted the Department of Education, which became a Cabinet agency in 1980 under President Jimmy Carter. Trump aides have prepared an executive order that would limit if not effectively shut down the department.

“I want Linda to put herself out of a job,” Trump said of Education Secretary-designee Linda McMahon, who awaits Senate confirmation.

The timing, though, remains uncertain as the White House grapples with how to unwind an agency that was established by law and involves billions in spending approved by Congress, including Title I money for low-income schools and college student loans.


Tightening restrictions on abortion pills and other actions
Trump sidestepped and obfuscated on abortion during the campaign. He bragged that his Supreme Court nominees helped overturn the Roe v. Wade precedent and shifted control of abortion restrictions to state governments — but said he would not sign a national ban. Then he changed course and said he would ban abortion later in pregnancy, though he did not specify when that would be.

Project 2025 proposes a range of ideas, most of which would come under the purview of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. if the Senate confirms him as Health and Human Services secretary:

— It seeks tighter restrictions on abortion pills, demand for which rose after Trump’s election. The document says the administration should revoke the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of medication abortion drugs. Short of that, if the drugs remain on the market, the document urges Trump to “reinstate earlier safety protocols for Mifeprex that were mostly eliminated in 2016 and apply these protocols to any generic version of mifepristone.” Specifically, Project 2025 calls for “a bare minimum” deadline of the 49th day of gestation for dispensing the drugs (it is now 70 days), requiring in-person dispensing, and requiring prescribers to report “all serious adverse events, not just deaths.” During his confirmation hearings last month, Kennedy said Trump has asked him to study mifepristone, a drug used to terminate pregnancies and help women complete miscarriages.

— If those paths are not sufficient to limit medication abortions, it proposes invoking an 1873 anti-obscenity law, the Comstock Act, as justification to block the mailing of any abortion-related materials. When asked during an April 12, 2024, interview with Time magazine for his views on the Comstock Act and the mailing of abortion pills, Trump promised to make a statement on the issue in the next 14 days, saying: “I feel very strongly about it. I actually think it’s a very important issue.” He never made that statement.
